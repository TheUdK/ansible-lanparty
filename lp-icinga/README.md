Icinga2 Ansible Role
====================
This role only contains deployment of the basic Icinga2 service including database schema and IDO config on the poller. This does NOT deploy a web interface or any other configuration yet.

From my experience, Icinga2 is a very powerful but not very user-friendly solution. It is completely cluster-oriented and has a rather complex architecture. Development of this playbook is on hold in favour of Observium.
